# Contact_Management_System

This Python script is a simple **Contact Management System** that allows users to add and view contacts. Contacts are stored in a JSON file (`contacts.json`), and the program provides options to add new contacts or view all saved contacts. It uses functions to load, save, and manage contacts, ensuring data persistence across program runs. The script runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
